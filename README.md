# landing-page

This is the final assignment from the intermediate html css course in odin

> I used the css position property to fix display the header, notification panel, and sidebar.

> I used flex properties for item layout in the header and sidebar along with grid display properties.

> I used the grid display property to display the main content cards on the page.

> I'll be adding some improvements on the dashboard in the future.

> The weird behaviour of the header can and should be fixed with display grid

> cursor pointer seems not to work with my button in the page

> there's an unexpected x-axis overflow scroll on the notification panel that seems not to be fixed with [overflow-x: hidden;]
